# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid user IDs.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route handler that fetches user data based on the ID provided in the route parameters.  However, it lacks error handling for cases where the user ID is invalid (e.g., not a number, doesn't exist in the database).

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a corrected version of the route handler. It includes error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs and return appropriate responses to the client.
